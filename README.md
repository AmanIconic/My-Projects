## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanIconic/My-Projects.git
cd My-Projects
```
2. **Install Required Python Libraries**

Most projects use:
```
pip install customtkinter requests
```
(If a project uses additional libraries, check for a `README.md` in that folder.)

3. **Navigate to a Project Folder**
```
cd "project 5"  # Example: Weather App
```
4. **Run the Python Script**
```
python main.py
```
Replace main.py with the actual filename inside the project folder (e.g., chatbot.py, weather_app.py)

## 📅 Purpose

This repository acts as a **central hub** for all my work — whether it's for practice, learning, or real-world solutions. Stay tuned for regular updates as I add more projects to this folder!

---
## 🧠 Tips
All UIs are built using CustomTkinter

Project folders are named like project 1, project 2, etc.

Each folder includes all necessary code and files (e.g., responses.json for the chatbot).
